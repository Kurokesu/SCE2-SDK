* [ ] open 2 terminals (gui and and tools paths)
* [ ] open camera preview tool (it talks with GUI program and will be used to auto save pictures as well)

--- calibrate infinity curve ---

* [ ] open gui, home lens, make sure camera can see the target at all zoom levels
* [ ] delete keypoints
* [ ] add new keypoints (make sure that zoom2 stays more or less on the original curve)
* [ ] exit gui (keypoints saved into the yaml file)

* [ ] wipe old auto calibration tool data structure
* [ ] auto sweep through all the keypints, save pictures
* [ ] calculate best focus point, and verify the results
* [ ] export calculated results back to the gui program (infinity)
* [ ] open gui program to verify how accurate is calibration

--- calibrate closeup curve ---

* [ ] open gui program, make sure camera can see the target at all zoom levels
* [ ] go through all the keypoints and refine focus
* [ ] exit gui 

* [ ] backup results folder (rename results to results_inf)
* [ ] wipe old auto calibration tool data structure
* [ ] auto sweep through all the keypints, save pictures
* [ ] calculate best focus point, and verify the results
* [ ] export calculated results back to the gui program (closeup)

* [ ] open gui program to verify how accurate is calibration
* [ ] verify if guided focus works as expected
